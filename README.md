# generative_text
This project implements a Generative Text Model designed to produce coherent and context-aware text using deep learning techniques such as RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers

1.Text Generation
Generate human-like text based on a prompt using a trained language model.

2.Custom Training
Train your own model on any text corpus (e.g., books, articles, conversations).

3.Pretrained Model Support
Optionally load and fine-tune popular pretrained models like GPT, LSTM, or Transformer-based architectures.

4.Prompt-based Generation
Start with a seed text and let the model generate a continuation.

5.Adjustable Parameters
Control temperature, top-k sampling, sequence length, and generation depth.

6.Dataset Agnostic
Works with any plain-text dataset with minimal preprocessing.

 7.Evaluation Tools
Includes perplexity scores, word frequency analysis, and sample quality testing.

Use Cases
Story or poetry generation

Chatbot and dialogue systems

Code auto-completion

Creative writing assistants
